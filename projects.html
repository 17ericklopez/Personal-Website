      <h1>My Projects</h1>
      <p>Here are some of the key projects I've worked on throughout my journey in computer science and beyond:</p>
      
      <div class="project">
        <!-- Project 1: 2-D Java Based Game -->
        <h2>2-D Java Based Game</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite projects I've worked on was a 2-D game based on the John Wick movies called <strong>Juan Wick</strong>. This game was developed as part of a team project in my Software Development class. As a beginner programmer, it was a huge learning experience and gave me a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) and game design.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools & Technologies Used:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Java</strong>: We used Java for the main game development. This included utilizing Java's built-in libraries such as Swing for graphical interfaces and event handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>: The game structure relied heavily on OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism to create reusable and modular code.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Loops & Collision Detection</strong>: Implemented the core game loop to update game logic in real-time and used algorithms to detect collisions between game objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphics & Animation</strong>: For creating the 2D game world, we incorporated sprites, and we utilized animation techniques to bring characters and objects to life on the screen.</li>
          </ul>

      </div>

      <!-- Project 2: BEST Robotics -->
      <div class="project">
        <h2>BEST Robotics</h2>
        <p>Another exciting project I worked on was designing and building a robot for the <strong>BEST Robotics Competition</strong>, a national competition held in the U.S. that challenges students to build robots from scratch based on certain themes and criteria. I participated in this competition in both 2016 and 2017, where I learned about hardware design, programming, and teamwork.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools & Technologies Used:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Arduino</strong>: We used Arduino microcontrollers to control the robot's movements, sensors, and actuators. Programming the Arduino was a challenge in itself but crucial for the robot’s functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>CAD Software</strong>: We used CAD software to design and plan out the robot’s structure before moving to the actual construction phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanical Design & Construction</strong>: The project involved building the robot’s frame, setting up motors, and attaching sensors based on the challenge’s theme.</li>
            <li><strong>Teamwork & Problem-Solving</strong>: This project helped improve my communication and problem-solving skills as we worked in a team to meet deadlines and adapt to unforeseen challenges.</li>
          </ul>

      <!-- Project 3: GuitaR-AI (Ongoing) -->
      <div class="project">
        <h2>GuitaR-AI (Currently)</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am working on an exciting project called <strong>GuitaR-AI</strong>, which aims to revolutionize how people learn guitar. The idea is to create a program that can isolate the guitar sound from a music track, separate it from other instruments, and then train an AI model to recognize guitar chords and notes. This way, users can easily learn how to play along with their favorite songs.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools & Technologies Used:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Python</strong>: Python is being used for data processing, machine learning, and audio manipulation. Libraries like <code>librosa</code> and <code>pydub</code> help process and separate the guitar audio from other tracks.</li>
              <li><strong>AI & Deep Learning</strong>: The AI model will be trained using deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to recognize guitar chords from audio data.</li>
              <li><strong>Music Theory</strong>: I’m also integrating some basic music theory into the program to ensure the AI can learn and play in a musically correct way.</li>
              <li><strong>TensorFlow/Keras</strong>: These libraries will be used to build and train the machine learning models to analyze the guitar sounds and output the correct chords.</li>
            </ul>
